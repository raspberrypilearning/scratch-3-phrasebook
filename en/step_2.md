The biggest visual change from Scratch 2.0 is that the stage is now located on the right side of the screen.
Some other changes you might notice include:
+ Sprite information is now always visible below the stage.
+ Updated block designs
+ Pen blocks have been moved into the extensions section.

Let's start by creating the main backdrop. The first backdrop will contain flags to represent the languages we are using.
Use the button in the bottom right corner to choose a backdrop.
